## Planning
What would be the best way to ensure I get these major food groups and the recommended quantities?
- Meal prepping every Sunday
- Containers that are grab and go
  - For freshness, maybe it would be best to prep every 3 days
  - For ease, it should be broken down into groups of containers that are easy to grab and go
  - Dont forget about water!
  - Additional thought: make breakfast, lunch pretty robotic. But do something special for dinners
